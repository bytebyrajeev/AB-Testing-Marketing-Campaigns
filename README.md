# ðŸ“Š A/B Testing on Marketing Campaigns (Facebook vs AdWords)

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares the performance of two marketing campaigns â€” **Facebook Ads** and **Google AdWords** â€” over a one-year period (2019).  
The primary objective is to determine **which platform delivers better ROI** in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-effectiveness.

By conducting exploratory analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing, we identify the **most effective advertising channel** and provide actionable business insights for marketing strategy optimization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
A marketing agency wants to optimize its ad budget allocation between **Facebook** and **AdWords** campaigns.  
The question:  
> Which ad platform is more effective in driving conversions and maintaining cost efficiency?

| Date | Daily record (Jan 1, 2019 â€“ Dec 31, 2019) |
| Ad Views | Number of times the ad was viewed |
| Ad Clicks | Number of clicks received |
| Ad Conversions | Number of conversions achieved |
| Cost per Ad | Daily cost of running the ad |
| CTR (Click Through Rate) | Clicks / Views |

## ðŸ§© Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  
- **SciPy**, **Statsmodels** â€“ Hypothesis testing & statistical analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Regression modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Parsed dates, handled missing values, ensured numeric consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Compared click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, and CPC between platforms.  
- Visualized time trends and cost distributions.

### 3. A/B Hypothesis Testing
- Tested whether differences in conversion rates and CPC are statistically significant.  
- Used two-sample t-tests and p-value interpretation.

### 4. Insights & Recommendations
- Interpreted trends, seasonality, and ROI implications.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Facebook Ads** demonstrated a higher **conversion rate** but slightly higher **cost per conversion (CPC)**.  
- **AdWords** performed better in **CTR**, but with lower overall conversions.  
- Conversion activity was **highest on Mondays and Tuesdays**.  
- **May and November** were the most **cost-efficient months** (lowest CPC).  
- A significant **long-term relationship** exists between ad spend and conversions (based on cointegration test).

---

## ðŸ’¡ Business Insights
- Allocate more ad budget to **Facebook during May & November** to maximize ROI.  
- **Reallocate weekday ad spend** to Mondayâ€“Tuesday for improved conversion rates.  
- Maintain a **balanced cross-platform strategy** to stabilize long-term performance.
